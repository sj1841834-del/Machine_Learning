        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression is based on several important assumptions. First, there must be a **linear relationship** between the independent and dependent variables. Second, the observations should be **independent**, meaning one observation should not influence another. Third, the model assumes **homoscedasticity**, where the variance of errors remains constant across all values of the independent variable. Fourth, the residuals should follow a **normal distribution**, especially for valid hypothesis testing. Fifth, the model assumes there are **no extreme outliers** that can distort the regression line. When these assumptions are satisfied, the regression results are reliable and meaningful.\n",

        "The coefficient *m* in the regression equation represents the **slope of the regression line**. It indicates the rate at which the dependent variable changes for a one-unit change in the independent variable. If the value of *m* is positive, it shows that Y increases as X increases. If *m* is negative, it shows that Y decreases as X increases. The absolute value of *m* represents the **strength of the relationship** between the variables. A larger magnitude indicates a stronger influence of X on Y. The slope plays a critical role in prediction and interpretation of regression results.\n",

        "The intercept *c* represents the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. It is the point where the regression line crosses the Y-axis. The intercept provides a **baseline value** for the regression model. In many practical situations, X = 0 may not be meaningful, but mathematically the intercept is essential. It helps in positioning the regression line accurately on the graph. The intercept ensures the completeness of the regression equation and contributes to accurate predictions.\n",

        "The least squares method is used to find the **best-fitting regression line** for a given dataset. Its main objective is to minimize the sum of squared residuals, where residuals are the differences between observed and predicted values. Squaring the errors ensures that both positive and negative deviations are treated equally. Larger errors are given more importance, leading to a balanced fit. This method produces unbiased and efficient estimates of regression coefficients. It is the most commonly used estimation technique in regression analysis.\n",

        "**Answer:**\n",
        "The coefficient of determination, denoted by R², measures how well the regression model explains the variation in the dependent variable. Its value lies between 0 and 1. A value of R² close to 1 indicates a strong relationship between variables, while a value close to 0 indicates a weak relationship. For example, R² = 0.75 means 75% of the variation in Y is explained by X. R² is commonly used to evaluate the goodness of fit of a regression model. However, it should not be used alone to judge model quality.\n",

Simple regression is easier to understand, visualize, and interpret. Multiple regression provides a more realistic model for real-world problems. However, multiple regression is more complex and may suffer from issues like multicollinearity.

        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Multiple Linear Regression is based on several assumptions. There must be a linear relationship between predictors and the dependent variable. Observations must be independent. The residuals should have constant variance, known as homoscedasticity. Independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other, avoiding multicollinearity. Residuals should follow a normal distribution. These assumptions ensure accurate coefficient estimation and valid hypothesis testing.\n",

        "Heteroscedasticity refers to a situation where the variance of residuals is not constant across all values of independent variables. Instead, the spread of errors changes systematically. This violates a key assumption of regression analysis. Heteroscedasticity leads to inefficient estimates of coefficients. It also causes incorrect standard errors, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests. Identifying heteroscedasticity is essential for improving model reliability and accuracy.\n",

        "Multicollinearity can be reduced by removing highly correlated independent variables. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is commonly used to detect multicollinearity. Combining correlated variables into a single variable can also help. Dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis are effective. Regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso regression further reduce multicollinearity. These methods improve model stability and interpretability.\n",

        "Categorical variables must be converted into numerical form before they can be used in regression. One-Hot Encoding creates binary variables for each category. Label Encoding assigns numerical labels to categories. Dummy variable encoding is used to avoid multicollinearity. These techniques ensure that categorical data can be processed by regression algorithms. Proper encoding improves model accuracy and interpretability.\n",

        "Interaction terms represent situations where the effect of one independent variable depends on the value of another variable. They are created by multiplying two independent variables. Interaction terms help capture combined effects that individual variables cannot explain alone. Including interaction terms improves model realism. They are widely used in economics, social sciences, and experimental research. Interaction terms enhance predictive performance.\n",

        "In Simple Linear Regression, the intercept represents the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. This interpretation is straightforward and often meaningful. In Multiple Linear Regression, the intercept represents the value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero. This scenario may not be realistic in practice. Therefore, interpretation of the intercept becomes more abstract in multiple regression. However, it remains mathematically essential.\n",

        "The slope indicates the direction and magnitude of the relationship between variables. It shows how much the dependent variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable. A positive slope indicates a direct relationship, while a negative slope indicates an inverse relationship. The slope is crucial for prediction and forecasting. It helps decision-makers understand the impact of changes in predictors. The slope is one of the most important components of regression analysis.\n",

Although this may not always be practical, it ensures proper positioning of the regression line. The intercept helps complete the regression equation. It contributes to accurate predictions across the data range. Without the intercept, the model may be biased.\n",

        "R² does not indicate causation between variables. It always increases when more predictors are added, even if they are irrelevant. R² does not penalize model complexity. It cannot detect overfitting. Therefore, relying solely on R² can be misleading. Adjusted R², error metrics, and validation techniques should also be used for proper model evaluation.\n",

        "A large standard error indicates that the coefficient estimate is imprecise. It suggests high variability in the estimate across samples. This may occur due to multicollinearity or small sample size. A large standard error reduces the statistical significance of the coefficient. It lowers confidence in predictions. Reducing noise and improving data quality can help lower standard errors.\n",

        "Heteroscedasticity can be identified when residual plots show a funnel-shaped or patterned spread. Instead of random scatter, residual variance changes with predictor values. This pattern indicates violation of constant variance assumption. Identifying heteroscedasticity is important for correcting model errors. Addressing it improves hypothesis testing accuracy. Techniques such as transformation and robust regression are used.\n",
